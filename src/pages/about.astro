	<p>
		I spend most of my time building, breaking and rebuilding things until they make sense. 
		Travel tech, distribution logic and anything involving systems talking to each other tends 
		to catch my attention faster than it should. I like clean structures, efficient workflows 
		and products that solve actual problems instead of creating decorative chaos.
	</p>

	<p>
		Over the years, I’ve worked across supply, partnerships and product. It’s a strange 
		cross-section but it gives me a clear view of what works, what doesn’t and what’s just 
		industry theatre. I prefer direct answers, transparent models and tech that doesn’t hide 
		behind buzzwords.
	</p>

	<p>
		This site is a space where I document ideas, experiments and things I’m currently building. 
		If you’re here looking for polished PR lines, you won’t find them. If you’re here for 
		useful insights, honest notes or a peek into how things actually function behind the scenes, 
		you’re in the right place.
	</p>

	<p>
		When I'm not working, I’m usually reading, sketching product flows or exploring new concepts 
		that may eventually turn into something bigger. Some ideas make it, most don’t. The process 
		is the point.

		If any of this resonates or you want to collaborate on something interesting, feel free to 
		reach out. Otherwise, enjoy the read. - Sanjay Johnson
